; The directory to store data such as the block chain and peer addresses.  The
; block chain takes several GB, so this location must have a lot of free space.
; The default is ~/.bsvd/data on POSIX OSes, $LOCALAPPDATA/Bsvd/data on Windows,
; ~/Library/Application Support/Bsvd/data on Mac OS, and $home/bsvd/data on
; Plan9.  Environment variables are expanded so they may be used.  NOTE: Windows
; environment variables are typically %VARIABLE%, but they must be accessed with
; $VARIABLE here.  Also, ~ is expanded to $LOCALAPPDATA on Windows.
; datadir=~/.bsvd/data

; Use testnet.
; testnet=1

; Connect via a SOCKS5 proxy.  NOTE: Specifying a proxy will disable listening
; for incoming connections unless listen addresses are provided via the 'listen'
; option.
; proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
; proxyuser=
; proxypass=

; The SOCKS5 proxy above is assumed to be Tor (https://www.torproject.org).
; If the proxy is not tor the following may be used to prevent using tor
; specific SOCKS queries to lookup addresses (this increases anonymity when tor
; is used by preventing your IP being leaked via DNS).
; noonion=1

; Use an alternative proxy to connect to .onion addresses. The proxy is assumed
; to be a Tor node. Non .onion addresses will be contacted with the main proxy
; or without a proxy if none is set.
; onion=127.0.0.1:9051
; onionuser=
; onionpass=

; Enable Tor stream isolation by randomizing proxy user credentials resulting in
; Tor creating a new circuit for each connection.  This makes it more difficult
; to correlate connections.
; torisolation=1

; Use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to automatically open the listen port
; and obtain the external IP address from supported devices.  NOTE: This option
; will have no effect if exernal IP addresses are specified.
; upnp=1

; Specify the external IP addresses your node is listening on.  One address per
; line.  bsvd will not contact 3rd-party sites to obtain external ip addresses.
; This means if you are behind NAT, your node will not be able to advertise a
; reachable address unless you specify it here or enable the 'upnp' option (and
; have a supported device).
; externalip=1.2.3.4
; externalip=2002::1234

; ******************************************************************************
; Summary of 'addpeer' versus 'connect'.
;
; Only one of the following two options, 'addpeer' and 'connect', may be
; specified.  Both allow you to specify peers that you want to stay connected
; with, but the behavior is slightly different.  By default, bsvd will query DNS
; to find peers to connect to, so unless you have a specific reason such as
; those described below, you probably won't need to modify anything here.
;
; 'addpeer' does not prevent connections to other peers discovered from
; the peers you are connected to and also lets the remote peers know you are
; available so they can notify other peers they can to connect to you.  This
; option might be useful if you are having problems finding a node for some
; reason (perhaps due to a firewall).
;
; 'connect', on the other hand, will ONLY connect to the specified peers and
; no others.  It also disables listening (unless you explicitly set listen
; addresses via the 'listen' option) and DNS seeding, so you will not be
; advertised as an available peer to the peers you connect to and won't accept
; connections from any other peers.  So, the 'connect' option effectively allows
; you to only connect to "trusted" peers.
; ******************************************************************************

; Add persistent peers to connect to as desired.  One peer per line.
; You may specify each IP address with or without a port.  The default port will
; be added automatically if one is not specified here.
; addpeer=192.168.1.1
; addpeer=10.0.0.2:8333
; addpeer=fe80::1
; addpeer=[fe80::2]:8333

; Add persistent peers that you ONLY want to connect to as desired.  One peer
; per line.  You may specify each IP address with or without a port.  The
; default port will be added automatically if one is not specified here.
; NOTE: Specifying this option has other side effects as described above in
; the 'addpeer' versus 'connect' summary section.
; connect=192.168.1.1
; connect=10.0.0.2:8333
; connect=fe80::1
; connect=[fe80::2]:8333

; Maximum number of inbound and outbound peers.
; maxpeers=125

; Disable DNS seeding for peers.  By default, when bsvd starts, it will use
; DNS to query for available peers to connect with.
; nodnsseed=1

; Specify the interfaces to listen on.  One listen address per line.
; NOTE: The default port is modified by some options such as 'testnet', so it is
; recommended to not specify a port and allow a proper default to be chosen
; unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
; All interfaces on default port (this is the default):
;  listen=
; All ipv4 interfaces on default port:
;  listen=0.0.0.0
; All ipv6 interfaces on default port:
;   listen=::
; All interfaces on port 8333:
;   listen=:8333
; All ipv4 interfaces on port 8333:
;   listen=0.0.0.0:8333
; All ipv6 interfaces on port 8333:
;   listen=[::]:8333
; Only ipv4 localhost on port 8333:
;   listen=127.0.0.1:8333
; Only ipv6 localhost on port 8333:
;   listen=[::1]:8333
; Only ipv4 localhost on non-standard port 8336:
;   listen=127.0.0.1:8336
; All interfaces on non-standard port 8336:
;   listen=:8336
; All ipv4 interfaces on non-standard port 8336:
;   listen=0.0.0.0:8336
; All ipv6 interfaces on non-standard port 8336:
;   listen=[::]:8336

; Disable listening for incoming connections.  This will override all listeners.
; nolisten=1

; Add additional checkpoints. Format: '<height>:<hash>'
; addcheckpoint=<height>:<hash>

; Add comments to the user agent that is advertised to peers.
; Must not include characters '/', ':', '(' and ')'.

; Debug logging level.
; Valid levels are {trace, debug, info, warn, error, critical}
; You may also specify <subsystem>=<level>,<subsystem2>=<level>,... to set
; log level for individual subsystems.  Use bsvd --debuglevel=show to list
; available subsystems.
